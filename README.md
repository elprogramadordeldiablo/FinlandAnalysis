## Disclaimer

This repository is a project from Rui Carvalho, feel free to contact me directly through my personal [e-mail](mailto:rui.m.carvalho@gmail.com).

## The working files are

* `ArthropodalphaBeta.R`  - This is the file where all the initial work of loading files, estimating total richness, calculating completeness, and calculationg taxonomicam and functional alphas and betas are done. In the end everything is compiled into a `RESULTS.csv` file, who is loaded again as `Results2`. This is the file that will be worked on on exploratory analysis and GLM/GLMM tests.

* `ExploratoryAnalyses.R` - File with... guess what. 

* `AlphaGLMM.R` -  I will be making glmm tests, this time with different Alphas: taxonomical, functional, All species, Natives and Introduced.

* `BetasGLMM.R` - I will be making glmm tests, this time with different Alphas: taxonomical, functional, All species, Natives and Introduced.

* `Results_GLM.R` - Taking a step back, and doing GLM on the data.
